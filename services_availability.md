# Continued availability for services
{: #services_availability}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} has identified a set of services as Tier 1. {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} doesn't withdraw any Tier 1 service without either making a functional equivalent available or providing at least five years notice of the withdrawal.

The following services are classified as Tier 1:
  * {{site.data.keyword.apiconnect_short}}
  * {{site.data.keyword.cloudant}}
  * {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}
  * {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}
  * {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}}
  * {{site.data.keyword.dashdbshort}}
  * {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}}
  * {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}
  * {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}}
  * {{site.data.keyword.appid_short}}

To read more about terms of use for services, see [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Terms](/docs/overview?topic=overview-terms).

## Service deprecation
{: #service_deprecation}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides at least 30 days notice of its intention to discontinue or replace a generally available service. If an equivalent replacement isn't provided, for at least 12 months from the date of that announcement, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} uses commercially reasonable means to continue the operation and support of previously deployed instances of the service.
